========================================================

###This is an R Markdown document for DV_RProject1. 
In this project, we first created  4 data frames, and created an interesting plot based on each data frame.

1. In the customers table, we can see there are more customers from different cities in CA.

2. In the orders table, we can see the shipped date is linearly correlated with order date,
   i.e. the products are mostly shipped out at the relatively same speed after the order.
   
3. In the order_detail table, we can see certain product are more popular by some customer, as indicated by order id.

4. In the item table, we can see the range of unit price and the distribution of the price.
