This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
source("../01 Data/create_data_frame.R", echo = TRUE)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
